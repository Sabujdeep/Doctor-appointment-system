# Doctor Appointment System!

This is a Full Stack Doctor Appointment System app, covering most of the features from booking an appointment to applying as doctor using MERN stack.


## Project Description

This app helps to book appointments, and also get appointment by applying as  a doctor.  It has a very simple UI which helps the user to get familiar with it and it's very easy to use. I have used **React** to build all the re-usable functional components, **Redux Toolkit** to manage the state. And for the backend part, I have used **Node** along with **Express** to build the server and **MongoDB** for the database.

## Installation Instruction

First create an application with the help of **create-react-app** which will create a react app for you, then you can clone this repo in you local environment. By this, you'll be able to run this app in your local env. just run **npm start** in your terminal and start using!

## Key Feature(s)

- This app also focuses on user security, as it uses *Bcrypt* library to hash the user password when a new user registers.
- It has *Notification* system, which notifies the user or doctor when there is a request.
- *JWT*'s been used to verify for stateless authentication, where the server does not need to maintain session data for each user.
